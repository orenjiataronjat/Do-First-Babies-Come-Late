# Do-First-Babies-Come-Late
(Using Matplotlib and thinkstats2 to process CDC data) Visualizing the problem of "Do first babies come late?". Data provided by Center for Disease Control's Survey of Family Growth. There is a clear trend but this survey is not representational of society and is not outside of the statistical range of 3%+. The other problem with the data is that there is a diminishing pool of data the more points you try to use since many people don't have more than 1 child and especially not more than 2.
